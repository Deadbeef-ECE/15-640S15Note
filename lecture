End-to-End Reasoning

(1)RPC with TCP & UDP
(2)Large File Transfer
chunk:recovery(TCP feature)

Make DS faster:
(1)delay: processing delay, transimission delay(don't care), queueing delay(dominate)

Queueing Theory:
Properties(consider AT MOST 2 OUT of 3):
(1) Efficiency(resource utilization); 
(2) Crispness(response time); 
(3) Freedom(no advance reservations, just use when needed).

Latency and Bandwith:
delay-Bandwith product(abort the request in the midway).

Latency(killer, not bandwith):hard to improve
Bandwith(improved through parallelism)

Many software and systems trends to increase the Latency

Impact of Long Latency:
synchronous model of RPC become infeasible
